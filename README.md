Skin Disease Classifier Training
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for training a machine learning classifier to detect skin diseases. The project involves image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, and evaluation using deep learning techniques.


Data preprocessing
Augmentation techniques to improve generalization
CNN model selection and training
Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Dataset Structure
Ensure your dataset follows this structure:


Training the Model
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SkinDiseaseClassifier.git
cd SkinDiseaseClassifier
Run the notebook

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook
Execute SkinDiseaseClassifierTraining.ipynb

Results
Model accuracy and loss graphs
Confusion matrix visualization
Class-wise precision, recall, and F1-score
You can further fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, adding more data, or using different architectures.
